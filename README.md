# AERMET_MetGather
Script to quickly gather 1/5 Minute data for AERMINUTE as well as ISH data for AERMETT<br />

NCDC has changed the url for gathering one and five minute met data from https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ to https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/<br />

For the 1 and 5 minute data, in the script just need to change the ICAO (64050KGPT2022)KGPT to whatever ICAO your wanting to pull throughout the whole script.<br />
For the ISH data, choose correct station_id <- "747570-93874" and line 33, direct to correct ICAO name to match station ID.
